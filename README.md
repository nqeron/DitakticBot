# DitakticBot #

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESSS ##

The aim of this work is to create an AI play tak with the following features:
 
 - Can be customized to allow friendly undos, similar to friendlyBot.
 - tei
 - can analyze tps or PTN
 - handles variable komi (NOTE: this is experimental)
 - supports no-swap (experimental)
 - multiple levels of difficulty
    - probably from a) time, b) depth, c) heuristic specifics
 - can respond to and set specific game settings in playtak, such as color, size, komi, no-swap, difficulty

 ### TO USE ###

 N/A - theoretically you could build some of my code, but it's not ready

 ### Progress ##

 At the moment, I can create a board with variable size, komi, and no-swap and make single plays on it. That's about it.
